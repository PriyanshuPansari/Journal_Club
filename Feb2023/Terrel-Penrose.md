# Abstract

The theory of special relativity predicts length contraction in the direction of motion of an object moving at relativistic speed. One expects to see the contraction in real life as well. However, due to finite time taken by light to reach the eyes or an image sensing device, the Lorentz contraction is not visible, instead what can be observed is apparent rotation and distortion of the object. This effect went unnoticed initially and was later studied independently by Terrell, Penrose and Lampa independently at different points of time. Henceforth, this phenomenon is commonly referred to as Terrell Rotation (or Terrell-Penrose effect) these days. In the forthcoming discussion, we shall do a brief review of the Lorentz transformations and relativistic length contraction as well as demonstrate mathematically how instead of contraction, apparent rotation and optical distortion of the object is observed.
